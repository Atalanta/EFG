<p>Hello <%= @resource.first_name %>!</p>

<p>Someone has requested a link to change your password, and you can do this through this link:</p>

<p><%= link_to 'Change my password', edit_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token) %></p>

<p>For security purposes, this link will expire after 7 days. If the link has expired, just go back to the <%= link_to 'login page', root_url %> and select 'Forgot your password' and you'll receive a new link.</p>

<p>If you didn't request this, please ignore this email.</p>

<p>Alternatively please contact your administrator.</p>

<p>Your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.</p>

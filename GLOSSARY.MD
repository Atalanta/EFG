# Overview
This captures the Ubiquitous Language for the service. By its very nature, some of the terms are defined in the legislation, but it is useful to have a common language when talking with the domain experts.

## CfE (Capital for Enterprise)
The government organisation which is the centre of knowledge and expertise in SME finance interventions, responsible for administering the EFG scheme. See http://www.capitalforenterprise.gov.uk/

## EFG (Enterprise Finance Guarantee)
A UK government-guaranteed lending scheme intended to help small businesses who may be struggling to secure finance, by facilitating bank loans of between £1,000 and £1,000,000. The scheme went live on 14th January 2009.

## Premium Schedule
The government changes 2% for guaranteeing the loan. This needs to be paid by the borrower on an agreed schedule, with an initial one-off payment and then regular payments every quarter after that.

## SFLG (Small Firms Loan Guarantee)
The precursor of the EFG scheme, which ran from 1981 to January 2009.

## State Aid
The government is only permitted to provide £X financial support for a company in a given time frame. Guaranteeing a loan is the not the same as granting the loan; there is a formula to convert the guarantee into a specific amount of Euros for State Aid purposes.

      body_text1: "Dear\n\nI am writing to provide you with the value of the State Aid applicable to the loan you have been offered through the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) should you accept it.\n\nThe assistance provided through EFG, like many Government-backed business support schemes, is regarded as a State Aid and is governed according to the European Commission's “De Minimis” State Aid rules. Under these rules the maximum State Aid any business or individual may receive over any rolling three-year period is currently 200,000 Euro. This letter is sent in accordance with European Commission Notice on State Aid in the form of Guarantees, OJ C155 of 20 June 2008."
      body_text2: "It is your responsibility to retain records of any State Aid arising from assistance received for a minimum of three years from the date of receipt and to ensure that you do not exceed the rolling three-year limit. If you make any other application for assistance during the next three years you should expect to be asked by the provider of that assistance about the State Aid you have already received.\n\nPlease note that this letter is issued solely to advise you of the value of State Aid arising from your loan and is not a notice of further funding.\n\nYours sincerely,"

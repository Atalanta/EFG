      body_text1: "Dear Sirs,\n\nI am writing to provide you with the value of the State Aid applicable to the loan you have been offered through the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) should you accept it.\n\nThe assistance provided through EFG, like many Government-backed business support schemes, is regarded as a State Aid and is governed according to the European Commission's “De Minimis” State Aid rules. Under these rules the maximum State Aid any business or individual may receive over any rolling three-year period is currently 200,000 Euro. This letter is sent in accordance with European Commission Notice on State Aid in the form of Guarantees, OJ C155 of 20 June 2008."
      body_text2: "It is your responsibility to retain records of any State Aid arising from assistance received for a minimum of three years from the date of receipt and to ensure that you do not exceed the rolling three-year limit. If you make any other application for assistance during the next three years you should expect to be asked by the provider of that assistance about the State Aid you have already received.\n\nPlease note that this letter is issued solely to advise you of the value of State Aid arising from your loan and is not a notice of further funding.\n\nYours sincerely,"

      title: "Enterprise Finance Guarantee - Notification of State Aid"
      state_aid: "The value of the de minimis aid arising from this facility is %{amount}."
      body_text1: "Dear Sirs,\n\nOur ability to provide you with this facility has been dependent upon a guarantee we have received from the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) under the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) scheme. The assistance provided through EFG, like many Government-backed business support activities, is regarded as a State aid and is deemed to benefit you as it has enabled us to provide you with a facility which would not otherwise have been possible.\n\nProvision of such State aid is governed by regulations made by the European Commission, details of which may be found in the Annex at the end of this letter. Under these rules the maximum State aid any undertaking may receive over any rolling three-year period is generally €200,000, although lower ceilings apply in certain sectors as detailed in the Annex."
      body_text2: "It is your responsibility to retain records of any State aid arising from assistance received for a minimum of ten years from the date of receipt and to ensure that you do not exceed the rolling three-year limit. If you make any other application to a support scheme which is deemed to provide State aid during the next three years you will be required to inform the operator of that scheme about the State aid advised by this letter and any other applicable aid from other sources.\n\nPlease note that this letter is issued solely to advise you of the value of the State aid arising from your facility and does not in any way alter any of the terms of our facility letter to you, nor is it a notice of further funding.\n\nYours sincerely,"

      annex_text1: "This information is provided for clarification and guidance."
      annex_text2: "The 'rolling three-year limit' is defined as follows:"
      annex_text3: "a) when considering the impact of previous aid on the provision of the present facility, the current fiscal year and the two preceding fiscal years; or"
      annex_text4: "b) when considering the impact of the aid attributable to the present facility on any future applications for aid, the current fiscal year and the two subsequent fiscal years."
      annex_text5: "With the 'current fiscal year' being the fiscal year in which the date of the facility letter for the present facility falls, with each EFG fiscal year running from 1st April to the following 31st March.\n\nAn 'undertaking' is defined as any entity engaged in economic activity, regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed. All entities controlled (on a legal or de facto basis) by the same entity are considered to be a single undertaking and thus collectively subject to the same single maximum permissible aid ceiling."
